Compatibility: 4.x
Parameters:
- name: enable_at_start
  description: |
    Enable hinterland's continuous hinting when notebook is first opened
  input_type: checkbox
  default: true
- name: exclude_regexp
  description: |
    A regular expression tested against the character before the cursor, which,
    if a match occurs, prevents autocompletion from being triggered. This is
    useful, for example, to prevent triggering autocomplete on a colon, which
    is included by the default Completer.reinvoke pattern. If blank, no test is
    performed.
  input_type: text
  default: ':'
- name: include_regexp
  description: |
    A regular expression tested against the character before the cursor, which
    must match in order for autocompletion to be triggered. If left blank, the
    value of the notebook's Completer.reinvoke_re parameter is used, which can
    be modified by kernels, but defaults to /[%0-9a-z._/\\:~-]/i
  input_type: text
  default: ''
- name: tooltip_regexp
  description: |
    A regular expression tested against the character before the cursor, which
    if it matches, causes a tooltip to be triggered, instead of regular
    autocompletion. For python, this is useful for example for function calls,
    so the default regex matches opening parentheses.
  input_type: text
  default: '\\('
