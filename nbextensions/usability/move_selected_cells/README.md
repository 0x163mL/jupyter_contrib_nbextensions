## Move selected cells

This is a quick (and dirty) extension - move up or down several selected cell*s*

It is a bit dirty because it would be better to act on DOM elements and write a correct move_cells() function. This will come. 
In the meantime, moving cells or series of cells via simple keystrokes is super useful

Keyboard shortcuts: *Alt-up* and *Alt-down* (works also with single cells!)

**Cell selection**: Cells can be selected using the rubberband (required extension) or via Shift-J and Shift-K
